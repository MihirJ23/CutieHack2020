Our creation for this year's Cutie Hack will be an app that is loosely based off the iOS app Tips, which gives Apple users advice on how to use their device, tips, and information about various topics.

However, we will cater our app to the theme of staying at home by configuring our app to giving notifications on tips on how not to stay bored during these hard times. These will include suggestions on how to pass your day, tips on new things to try or challenges to complete, and motivational quotes or stories on inspire the user to keep pushing through day by day.
